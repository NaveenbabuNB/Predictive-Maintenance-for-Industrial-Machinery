# Industrial Machinery Predictive Maintenance

## Overview
This repository hosts a predictive maintenance project tailored for industrial machinery, aiming to forecast maintenance needs and optimize operational efficiency. Predictive maintenance leverages machine learning algorithms to predict equipment failures before they occur, thereby reducing downtime, minimizing maintenance costs, and enhancing overall productivity.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is synthetically generated to simulate real-world sensor data from industrial machinery. It comprises various parameters including temperature, pressure, vibration, and operating time, alongside a binary target variable indicating whether maintenance is required.

## Project Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains the synthetic dataset in CSV format.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks housing code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts catering to different phases of the predictive maintenance pipeline.
- **`README.md`**: Description file providing a comprehensive overview of the project, dataset, and repository contents.

## Getting Started
To commence with the project:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Explore Notebooks**: Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to delve into the code.
3. **Execute the Code**: Run the notebooks or scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
4. **Experiment and Enhance**: Experiment with diverse machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to enhance the model's performance.
